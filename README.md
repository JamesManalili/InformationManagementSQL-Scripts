# Information Management 1 - SQL Script Compilation

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts and views developed during my coursework in Information Management 1. The database used in this project is a fictitious company named Hope, Inc., and the scripts cover a wide range of SQL topics including DDL, DML, joins, aggregations, subqueries, views, window functions, and stored procedures/functions.
