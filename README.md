# Information Management 1 - SQL Script Compilation

This repository contains a comprehensive collection of SQL scripts and views developed during my coursework in Information Management 1. The database used in this project is a fictitious company named Hope, Inc., and the scripts cover a wide range of SQL topics practiced throughout the semester.

## Covered SQL Topics
The scripts demonstrate various SQL concepts including:

- DDL – Table creation, constraints, relationships
- DML – Insert, update, and delete statements
- Joins – Inner, Left, Right, and simulated Full Outer Joins
- Aggregations – GROUP BY, HAVING, SUM, AVG, COUNT, etc.
- Views – Reusable virtual tables for reporting and analytics
- Window Functions – RANK(), ROW_NUMBER(), SUM() OVER
